## Notes
Download and install R and python and get the most useful package for machine learning in R and python.
Load a dataset and understand it’s structure using statistical summaries and data visualization.
Create 5 machine learning models, pick the best and build confidence that the accuracy is reliable.

## work done
In this I loaded iris data
summarized the dataset
visualized the dataset
evaluated machine learning algorithms
following this I used the code provided to make a prediction of what is the best to use
